# Connect4_Wordle

Description of game:
The game will be *Connect4 with a twist of Wordle*. 
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Game Rules: 
1. There are two players in the game, player@ and player#.
2. Each player takes turns to input a chess piece into a column. 
3. The chess piece of player@ is '@' and the chess piece of player# is '#'.
4. When a playerâ€™s chess pieces form a line of 4 either vertically, horizontally or diagonally, the player wins.
 
5. After each turn, the player will have a 8% chance to win a bonus move. 
6. If a bonus is triggered, the player needs to solve the Wordle. 
7. If the Wordle is solved, the player can input an extra piece; if not, it is the next player's turn. Keep in mind that each player can at most input 2 chess   pieces consecutively.
 
8. In Wordle, the player has to guess a randomly-generated word. 
9. The player can choose whether he/she wants to guess a 5-letter word, 6-letter word or a 7-letter word.
10. The number of guesses a player gets depends on the size of the word. (5 guesses for a 5-letter word, 6 guesses for a 6-letter word and 7 guesses for a 7-letter word)
11. In each try, the player will guess any one word. 
12. After each try, the computer will output the player's guess letter by letter in the following way:
    a) If the letter is uppercase, it means it is the correct letter in the correct position. 
    b) If the letter is lowercase, it means the letter is in the word but it is at the wrong position. 
    c) If the letter is not in the word, it means the letter is not in the word. 
13. This output after each guess serves as a hint for the player's next guess.
